    "To meet the goal building a predictive model that can accurately classify or predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on the given features or attributes in the dataset. a comprehensive analysis of the dataset was conducted to understand the characteristics of the features, identify missing values, outliers, and any potential correlations or patterns among the variables. we have been given two CSV files raw_data.csv and validation.csv, both csv files contain 12 independent variables and 1 target variable. The only difference is that raw data file has 614 rows whilst the validation file has 367 rows. the raw data file will be used to train the models that will developed for predicting loan eligibility whilst the validation data file will be used to evaluate the model."

    "Data analysis is more efficient with visualization hence the matplotlib library was used to visualize the target variable loan status using a pie chart. The pie chart illustrates that 68.7 people out of the 614 in the raw dataset were approved for a loan. The matplotlib library was used to visualize the other libaries and we determined that almost 20% of applicants in the dataset are female, around 65% of the applicants in the dataset are married, about 15% of applicants in the dataset are self-employed, about 85% of applicants have repaid their debts, most of the applicants don’t have dependents, about 80% of the applicants are graduates, most of the applicants are from semi-urban areas. This meant that the dataset was not normally distributed."

    "This stage of the project was about handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary feature scaling or transformations to prepare the data for modeling. Through analysis we were able to determine that there are 6 features in the dataset that have missing values. The solution to this problem was to impute missing values by using mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features. Through analysis of the data the loan ID features was found to be irrelevant and therefore was removed from the dataset.\n",

    "This document outlines that through the use of machine learning BC Finance Company can \n",
    "automate the loan eligibility process. By using the provided CSV data we can use this in order to \n",
    "evaluate  different dataopints such as credit history , income , number of dependencies etc. \n",
    "Due to the model learning this information it can create less wait times for each customer, this \n",
    "would save BC Company a lot of time and resources as they could use this time to do other \n",
    "tasks. \n",
    "Stakeholders: \n",
    "BC Finance Company: Due to loans being given at a higher faster rate this would allow BC to \n",
    "gain an advantage due to an increase in the home loan customer base, and leading to more \n",
    "happy customers, This date can be utilized to understanding their potential market more. \n",
    "NCR (National Credit Regulator) and other governmental agencies: Having  this model would \n",
    "allow them to understand and better the loan approval process while simultaneously \n",
    "monitoring and ensuring that fair lending processes are occurring. This would allow them to \n",

    "their loan eligibility creating more trust between the recipients and BC. Therefore eliminating \n",
