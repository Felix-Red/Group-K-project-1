# Loan status prediction using machine learning

This project is a machine learning system that employs Support Vector Machines (SVMs) - supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.

## Overview

In this project, the Support Vector Machine algorithm is utilized for the classification of whether a user is approved for a loan or not. The system analyzes user-provided data to determine loan approval status.
